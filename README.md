# Description
This is a template for server side rendering with Vue.js. It does not use any frameworks to carry out server side rendering, instead uses a custom build

# ENV variables
ENV variables should be created in the config folder with the following naming convention **envname.env.js**

If no ENV files are present, the app will fallback to the example.env.dev file

The name of the file must correspond with the NODE_ENV that is set when the app is started
